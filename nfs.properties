# attribute and lookup caching
#
# The properties are applied to two otherwise independent caches: the attribute and lookup caches.
#
# Lookup caching saves the translation from a path to a PNFS-ID and attribute caching saves the
# basic metadata of a file or directory (ownership, permissions, size, etc).
#
# That cached values will be released if memory becomes tight but, as the order of object
# recycling isn't guaranteed, it's best to avoid caching too many objects.
